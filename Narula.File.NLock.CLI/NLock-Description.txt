Technical Description:
NLock is a comprehensive file encryption solution that provides multi-factor authentication for securing files. The system consists of four main components: a shared library (NLock.Lib), a Windows Forms lock application (NLock.Lock), a Windows Forms unlock application (NLock.Unlock), and a command-line interface (NLock.CLI). The core functionality revolves around encrypting files using AES-256 encryption with a password, while also requiring a Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) for additional security.

The locking process works by taking a source file and encrypting it using a user-provided password combined with a randomly generated salt. The system also generates a TOTP secret key (Base32 encoded) that gets encrypted and stored alongside the file data. During encryption, the file is encrypted with AES-256 using an explicit initialization vector (IV), and the TOTP secret is separately encrypted with its own IV. The encrypted file is saved with a .nlock extension and contains the salt, password hash, encrypted file data, encrypted TOTP secret, and both IVs.

To unlock a file, users must provide both the correct password and a valid TOTP authentication code generated by an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator or Authy). The system validates the password by comparing hashes, derives the encryption key, decrypts the TOTP secret, validates the provided TOTP code against the secret (with a ±1 window for timing tolerance), and only then decrypts and restores the original file. The solution includes QR code generation for easy setup of TOTP secrets in authenticator apps, secure memory cleanup to prevent sensitive data from remaining in memory, and comprehensive error handling for various failure scenarios.



Product Description:
NLock is a secure file protection tool that combines strong encryption with multi-factor authentication. It allows users to lock and unlock files using both a password and a time-based one-time code generated by an authenticator app. Designed for reliability and ease of use, NLock ensures that only verified users can access protected data while maintaining compatibility with standard Windows environments.
